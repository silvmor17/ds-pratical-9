Expand the Order_Details table that is related to the Orders table, to combine the ProductID,
UnitPrice, and Quantity columns from Order_Details into the Orders table.
The Expand operation combines columns from a related table into a subject table. When the query
runs, rows from the related table (Order_Details) are combined into rows from the subject table
(Orders).
After you expand the Order_Details table, three new columns and additional rows are added to the
Orders table, one for each row in the nested or related table.
1. In the Query View, scroll to the Order_Details column.
2. In the Order_Details column, select the expand icon ().
3. In the Expand drop-down: a. Select (Select All Columns) to clear all columns.
Select ProductID, UnitPrice, and Quantity.
click OK.
Step 3: Remove other columns to only display columns of interest
In this step you remove all columns except OrderDate, ShipCity, ShipCountry,
Order_Details.ProductID, Order_Details.UnitPrice, and Order_Details.Quantity columns. In the
previous task, you used Remove Other Columns. For this task, you remove selected columns.
In the Query View, select all columns by completing a.
a. Click the first column (OrderID).
b. Shift+Click the last column (Shipper).
c. Now that all columns are selected, use Ctrl+Click to unselect the following columns:

Step 4: Calculate the line total for each Order_Details row
Power BI Desktop lets you to create calculations based on the columns you are importing, so you can
enrich the data that you connect to. In this step, you create a Custom Column to calculate the line
total for each Order_Details row.
Calculate the line total for each Order_Details row:
1. In the Add Column ribbon tab, click Add Custom Column.
2. In the Add Custom Column dialog box, in the Custom Column Formula textbox, enter
[Order_Details.UnitPrice] * [Order_Details.Quantity].
3. In the New column name textbox, enter LineTotal.

Task 4: Build visuals using your data
Step 1: Create charts showing Units in Stock by Product and Total Sales by Year
3. Next, drag ShipCountry to a space on the canvas in the top right. Because you selected a
geographic field, a map was created automatically. Now drag LineTotal to the Values
field; the circles on the map for each country are now relative in size to the LineTotal
for orders shipped to that country.
